Dear Emperor,

Let me talk about my skills.

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Typst

You can check Quarto Typst documentation at <https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/typst.html>.

### Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
#| label: fig-my-plot
#| fig-cap: "My Plot"
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = disp)) + geom_point()
```

You can also cite your plot @fig-my-plot.

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
